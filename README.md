# hello-world

## General info

So this is my first attempt at creating something in GitHub... I do know how to use Markdown and will be using it extensively here.

I'm learning to code in Python and on the way towards my career change from the insurance industry into cyber security, by way of a bootcamp starting in October.

See you on the other end!
